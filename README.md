# ORME-commerce

## Description

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites. Our challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site and take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
